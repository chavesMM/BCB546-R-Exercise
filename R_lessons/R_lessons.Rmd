## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# INTRODUCTION TO R

# Challenge 1:
Create a readme file = create a markdown file

# Challenge 2:
1. Create a directory within your project called graphs.
Can either create from R console with dir.create or in Terminal with

$ mkdir "graphs"

```{r MKDIR}
dir.create(graphs)
```

2. Modify the .gitignore file to contain graphs/ so that this disposable output isn’t versioned.

This is a text file that specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore (we dont want Git to track them), Git wont include them when you make commits or check status of repository

$ echo "graphs/" >> .gitignore

# Challenge 3:
1. In GitHub, create a New repository, called here BCB546-R-Exercise. Don’t initialize it with a README file because we’ll be importing an existing repository…

2. Make sure you have a proper public key in your GitHub settings

You can add a new key to a new computer/system, google it.

3. In RStudio, again click Tools -> Shell … . Enter
$ echo "# BCB546-R-Exercise" >> README.md
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "first commit"
$ git remote add origin git@github.com/[path to your directory]
$ git push -u origin main

These instructions also appear in Git once a repository is created

# R operators

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations

Arithmetic operators:
parentheses, exponents, divide, multiply, subtract, add...

```{r operators}
1 + 100
((3 + 5) * 2)^5
5e3 
```
Relational operators:
less than, greater than, less than or equal to, equal to, not equal to

```{r operators}
1 < 2 # less than
1 > 2 # greater than
1 == 1 # equal to
1!= 1 # not equal to
```
Due to machine numeric tolerance, you need to use the all.equal function to represent decimal numbers

Integers = whole numbers without fractions or decimals
```{r operators}
0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3

all.equal(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3)
```
Other operators
Logical, assignment, miscellaneous

# Cancelling commands
To kill incomplete commands or stop running code use "ctrl + c" or "Esc"


# VARIABLES AND ASSIGNMENT

Variable = named storage that we can use to manipulate.
Assignment operator used to assign variables is: 

$ <-

Assign does not print a value, but stores the value in a variable in the environment tab of R. 
Variables can be used to replace data in a calculation/script. variables can be reassigned
Assignment values can contain the variable being assigned to
The right side of the variable can be any valid R expression
shortcut use "alt -" , can also use = 
```{r variables}
x <- 100
x^2
x <- x + 1
y = 2
```
Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and periods. They cannot start with a number nor contain spaces at all.

# VECTORIZATION

R is vectorized, meaning that variables and functions can have vectors as values.
Creating vectors:
```{r vectorization}
c(2,4,6) # join elements into a vector
1:5 # create an integer sequence
seq(2,3, by=0.5) # create a sequence with a specific increment
rep(1:2, times=3) # repeat a vector
rep(1:2, each=3) #repeat elements of a vector

```

# push - pull changes
$ git pull
$ git add.
$ git commit -m "description"
$ git push

# MANAGING YOUR ENVIRONMENT

Useful commands
() is used to call function
```{r commands}
ls() # lists variables
list.files() # list files 
ls(all.names=TRUE) # to list files named with a "." that might be hiden
ls # prints the source code for the function
```

```{r commands}
rm (x) # to delete objects we dont need
rm(list = ls()) # to delete all objects at the same time
```

Errors = shown where R cannot proceed with a calculation
Warnings = mean that function has run, but probably didnt work as expected

## R packages
You can add functions to R by writing a package or downloading package from someone else.

```{r packages}
installed.packages() # to view what packages are already installed
install.packages("packagename") # to install a package
update.packages() # to update an installed package
remove.packages("packagename") # to delete a package
library(packagename) # to make a package available for use
```

# writing your own code

To learn good coding style
Google's R style guide https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml

formatR package to clean poorly formatted code.

# looking for help
```{r packages}
? function_name
help(function_name)
# will load up a help page, includes description, usage, arguments, examples...
? "+" # help with operators use quotes
help("package name")
vignette() # help for packages tutorials and extended documentation. Vignette() will list all vignettes for all installed packages
vignette(package="package-name") # will list all available vignettes for package-name
vignette("vignette-name") # will open a specific vignette
```


When you kind of remember the function

```{r packages}
?? function_name #not sure what package your function is in or the name of the function
```

When you dont know where to start
what package or function to use? CRAN task views is a mantained list of packages grouped into fields.

$ dput will dump your data into a copy-pasted format 

```{r packages}
?dput #will dump your data into a copy-pasted format 
sessionInfo() #will print out current version of R, and packaged loaded
```

#DATA STRUCTURES

R data structure organized by dimensionality 1D-2D-nD.
If they are homogeneous = all contents must be of the same type
- Atomic vector
- Matrix
- Array

If they are heterogeneous = contents can be of different types
- List
- Data frame

Individual numbers (strings)are vectors (variables) of length one.

```{r data structure}
str() # find data structure of a variable
```

## Vectors

Basic data structure
Two types:
1. Atomic vectors
2. Lists

Properties:
- Type, what it is
$ typeof()
- Length, how many elements it contains
$ length()
- Attributes, additional data
$ attributes()

## 1. Atomic vectors

4 types of atomic vectors:
- logical
- integer
- double/numeric
- character

create vectors usually with c() -means combine

```{r data structure}
dlb_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)

int_var <- c(1L,6L,10L) # adding L to get an integer and not a double

#logical vectors using True (T) or False (F)
log_var <-  c(TRUE,FALSE, T, F)

chr_var <-  c("these are","some strings")

c(1, c(2, c(3,4)))
``` 

Missing values = NA. Logical vector of length one.
NA will always be coerced to the correct type if used inside c().

## Coercion

Refers to the automatic conversion of data from one data type to another. 
Occurs implicitly when R expects data of a certain type but receives data of a different type.

All elements of an atomic vector must be the same type, so when you attempt to combine different types they will be coerced to the most flexible type. 

The coercion rules go (transformed into): logical -> integer -> double -> complex -> character

```{r data structure}
a <- c("a",1)
b <- c(TRUE, 1)
c <- c(1L, 10)
d <- c(a, b, c)
``` 

```{r data structure}
typeof(a)
typeof(b)
typeof(c)
typeof(d)
``` 

You can force the coercion with
$ as.character()
$ as.logical()
$ as.double()
$ as.integer()

When a logical vector is coerced to an integer or double, TRUE becomes 1 and FALSE becomes 0. This is very useful in conjunction with sum() and mean(), which will calculate the total number and proportion of “TRUE’s”, respectively.

## 2. LISTS

Lists are one dimensional data structures that are different from atomic vectors because their elements can be of any type, including lists. 

We construct lists by using list() instead of c():

```{r data structure}
x <- c(1,2,3) #cretaes vector
y <- list(1,2,3) #length 3
z <- list(1:3, "a", c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), c(2.3, 5.9)) #length 4 and different types
```

```{r data structure}
typeof(y)
str(y) # shows content
str(z)
```
Lists are sometimes called recursive vectors, because a list can contain other lists. This makes them fundamentally different from atomic vectors.

```{r data structure}
g <- list(list(list(list())))
str(g)

is.recursive(g)
```

c() VS list()
c() will combine several lists into one. If given a combination of atomic vectors and lists, c() will coerce the vectors to lists before combining them.

```{r data structure}
r <- list(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))
t <- c(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))
str(r); str(t)
```
more tips:
The typeof() a list is list. You can test for a list with is.list() and coerce to a list with as.list(). You can turn a list into an atomic vector with unlist(). If the elements of a list have different types, unlist() uses the same coercion rules as c().

## ATTRIBUTES

All objects can have arbitrary additional attributes, used to store metadata about the object
$ attr()

```{r data structure}
attr()
# or
attributes()
```

Most important attributes:
- Names:  a character vector giving each element a name
$ names()
- Dimensions: turn vectors into matrices and arrays
$ dim()
- Class: used to implement the S3 object system
$ class()

### naming elements in a vector

- When creating a vector: 
$ x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
- By modifying an existing vector in place: 
$ x <- 1:3; names(x) <- c("a", "b", "c")
- By creating a modified copy of a vector: 
$ x <- 1:3; x <- setNames(x, c("a", "b", "c"))

```{r data structure}
x <- 1:3
x <- setNames(x,c("a","b","c"))
x

```

```{r data structure}
names(x)

```
Names don’t have to be unique and not all elements of a vector need to have a name. If some names are missing, names() will return an empty string for those elements. If all names are missing, names() will return NULL.

You can create a new vector without names using unname(x), or remove names in place with names(x) <- NULL.
```{r data structure}
unname(x)

```
### Factors
A factor is a vector that can contain only predefined values, and is used to store categorical data. Factors are built on top of integer vectors using two attributes: the class(), “factor”, which makes them behave differently from regular integer vectors, and the levels(), which defines the set of allowed values.

```{r data structure}
x <- c("a", "b", "b", "a")
x
```

```{r data structure}
x <- factor(x)
x
class(x)
levels(x)
```
Factors are useful when you know the possible values a variable may take. Using a factor instead of a character vector makes it obvious when some groups contain no observations:
```{r data structure}
sex_char <- c("m", "m", "m") # using a character vector
sex_factor <- factor(sex_char, levels = c("m", "f")) #using a factor instead

table(sex_char)
table(sex_factor)
```
### Matrices and arrays

Adding a dim() attribute to an atomic vector allows it to behave like a multi-dimensional array. An array with two dimensions is called matrix. Matrices are used commonly as part of the mathematical machinery of statistics. Arrays are much rarer, but worth being aware of.

Matrices and arrays are created with matrix() and array(), or by using the assignment form of dim().

```{r data structure}
# Two scalar arguments to specify rows and columns
a <- matrix(1:6, ncol = 3, nrow = 2)
# One vector argument to describe all dimensions
b <- array(1:12, c(2, 3, 2))
# You can also modify an object in place by setting dim()
c <- 1:12
dim(c) <- c(3, 4)
c

x1 <- array(1:5, c(1, 1, 5))

```
### Data Frames

Used to store data in R.
A data frame is a list of equal-length vectors --> it's a 2D structure

```{r data structure}
# data frame functions
head() #shows first 6 rows
tail() #shows last 6 rows
dim()  #returns the dimensions of data frame (i.e. number of rows and number of columns)
nrow() #number of rows
ncol() #number of columns
str()  #structure of data frame - name, type and preview of data in each column
names() #shows the names attribute for a data frame, which gives the column names.
sapply(dataframe, class) # shows the class of each column in the data frame
```


#### creating Data frames

$ data.frame() , takes named vectors as input
```{r data structure}

df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) # turn of behavior of turning strings into factors
str(df)
```


check if an object is a data frame

```{r data structure}
class(df)
#or
is.data.frame(df)

is.vector(df)
is.list(df) #list is the vector used to build data frames
typeof(df)

```
coerce an object to a data frame
$ as.data.frame()

- A vector will create a one-column data frame.
- A list will create one column for each element; it’s an error if they’re not all the same length.
- A matrix will create a data frame with the same number of columns and rows as the matrix.
